Hi, Iâ€™m Matthieu Napoli, a software engineer passionate about coding, web development and architecture.

I like to build [open source software](https://github.com/mnapoli), for example:

- [PHP-DI](http://php-di.org/), a dependency injection container for PHP
- [isitmaintained.com](http://isitmaintained.com/), to check the activity of open source projects
- [Couscous](https://github.com/mnapoli/Couscous), a tool to generate online documentation from your Markdown sources
- [externals.io](http://externals.io/), a web interface to read PHP's internal discussions

You can read more about me on my [Stack Overflow career page](https://stackoverflow.com/story/mnapoli)
or my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieunapoli/en).
